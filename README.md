## What is MCP? ü§î

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a system that lets AI apps, like Claude Desktop, connect to external tools and data sources. It gives a clear and safe way for AI assistants to work with local services and APIs while keeping the user in control.

## What does this server do? üöÄ

The Exa MCP server provides two main sets of functionality:

### 1. Direct Exa Search API Access
- Enables real-time web searches with full content extraction using Exa's powerful search API
- Supports specialized searches for Twitter/X.com content and academic research papers
- Features HTTP streaming support for faster results delivery
- Handles rate limiting and error cases gracefully

### 2. Exa Websets Management
- Create and manage curated collections of web content (Websets)
- Track and manage items within your Websets
- Configure webhooks for automation workflows
- Monitor events related to your Websets
- Automate content curation workflows

## Prerequisites üìã

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- An [Exa API key](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)
- Git installed

You can verify your Node.js installation by running:
```bash
node --version  # Should show v18.0.0 or higher
```

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### NPM Installation

```bash
npm install -g exa-mcp-server
```

### Using Smithery

To install the Exa MCP server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/exa):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install exa --client claude
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server.git
cd exa-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Create a global link (this makes the server executable from anywhere):

```bash

```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. Configure Claude Desktop to recognize the Exa MCP server

You can find claude_desktop_config.json inside the settings of Claude Desktop app:

Open the Claude Desktop app and enable Developer Mode from the top-left menu bar. 

Once enabled, open Settings (also from the top-left menu bar) and navigate to the Developer Option, where you'll find the Edit Config button. Clicking it will open the claude_desktop_config.json file, allowing you to make the necessary edits. 

OR (if you want to open claude_desktop_config.json from terminal)

#### For macOS:

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration:

```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

#### For Windows:

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration:

```powershell
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 2. Add the Exa server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/exa-mcp-server/build/index.js",
        "--tools=web_search,initiate_webset,get_webset_status,list_websets"
      ],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Exa API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys).

### 3. Available Tools & Tool Selection

The Exa MCP server includes the following tools:

#### Direct Search Tools
- **web_search**: Performs real-time web searches with optimized results and content extraction. Supports HTTP streaming for faster results delivery.
- **research_paper_search**: Specialized search focused on academic papers and research content. Supports HTTP streaming.
- **twitter_search**: Dedicated Twitter/X.com search that finds tweets, profiles, and conversations. Supports HTTP streaming.

#### Websets Management Tools
- **create_webset**: [DEPRECATED] Create a new Webset for curated web content collections. May time out for long-running operations.
- **get_webset**: [DEPRECATED] Retrieve a specific Webset by ID.
- **initiate_webset**: Start the creation of a new Webset and immediately return with a tracking ID. Solves the timeout problem.
- **get_webset_status**: Check the status of a Webset creation process and retrieve results when complete.
- **update_webset**: Update an existing Webset's metadata.
- **list_websets**: List all available Websets with pagination support.
- **cancel_webset**: Cancel a running Webset.
- **delete_webset**: Delete a Webset by ID.

#### Two-Phase Webset Creation

Websets creation can be a long-running process that may exceed typical MCP timeouts (60 seconds). To solve this issue, we've implemented a two-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: Initiate Webset Creation**
   - Use the `initiate_webset` tool to start the process
   - Returns immediately with a Webset ID for tracking

2. **Phase 2: Check Status & Retrieve Results**  
   - Use the `get_webset_status` tool with the Webset ID
   - Check periodically until completion
   - When `isComplete=true`, the full results are available

Example pattern for Claude:
```
# First create the webset and get the ID
Call initiate_webset with your search parameters
Remember the websetId from the response

# Then periodically check status until complete
Call get_webset_status with the websetId
Wait a reasonable time (5-15 seconds) if still in progress
Repeat until isComplete=true
```

Here's an example of the typical interaction flow:

1. **Start the webset creation:**
   ```
   Claude, please initiate a webset with a search for "AI startups in healthcare" and find 20 results.
   ```

2. **Claude initiates the webset using the initiate_webset tool and receives a tracking ID:**
   ```json
   {
     "websetId": "wbs_01H2X3Y4Z5A6B7C8D9E0F",
     "status": "running",
     "searchStatus": "created",
     "message": "Webset creation initiated. Use get_webset_status to check progress and retrieve results when complete."
   }
   ```

3. **The user asks to check status:**
   ```
   Check if that webset is ready yet. If not, let me know the progress.
   ```

4. **Claude checks status using get_webset_status:**
   ```json
   {
     "websetId": "wbs_01H2X3Y4Z5A6B7C8D9E0F",
     "status": "running",
     "searchStatus": "running",
     "progressPercent": 35,
     "isComplete": false,
     "isCanceled": false,
     "message": "Webset creation in progress. Continue checking with get_webset_status."
   }
   ```

5. **After a few more status checks, the webset completes:**
   ```json
   {
     "websetId": "wbs_01H2X3Y4Z5A6B7C8D9E0F",
     "status": "idle",
     "searchStatus": "completed",
     "progressPercent": 100,
     "isComplete": true,
     "isCanceled": false,
     "details": {
       // Full webset details here
     }
   }
   ```

### Running the Two-Phase Demo

We've included a demo script that shows how the two-phase approach works outside of Claude:

```bash
# Navigate to the examples directory
cd examples

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the demo (replace with your actual API key)
EXA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here npm run demo
```

This script demonstrates:
1. How to initiate a webset creation
2. How to poll for status until completion
3. How to handle the completed results

You can use this pattern in your own applications when working with long-running Exa Websets.

#### Webset Items Tools
- **get_item**: Retrieve a specific item from a Webset.
- **list_items**: List all items in a Webset with filtering options and streaming support.

#### Webhook Management Tools
- **create_webhook**: Register a new webhook for Websets events.
- **get_webhook**: Retrieve a specific webhook by ID.
- **update_webhook**: Update an existing webhook's configuration.
- **delete_webhook**: Delete a webhook by ID.
- **list_webhooks**: List all registered webhooks.
- **list_webhook_attempts**: View webhook delivery attempts for debugging.

#### Events Tools
- **list_events**: List all events that have occurred in the Websets system. Supports HTTP streaming.
- **get_event**: Retrieve a specific event by ID.

You can choose which tools to enable by adding the `--tools` parameter to your Claude Desktop configuration:

#### Specify which tools to enable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/exa-mcp-server/build/index.js",
        "--tools=web_search,create_webset,list_webhooks"
      ],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

For the changes to take effect:

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. Look for the üîå icon to verify the Exa server is connected

## Using via NPX

If you prefer to run the server directly, you can use npx:

```bash
# Run with all tools enabled by default
npx exa-mcp-server

# Enable specific tools only
npx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search

# Enable multiple tools
npx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search,research_paper_search

# List all available tools
npx exa-mcp-server --list-tools
```

## Usage üéØ

Once configured, you can interact with the Exa MCP server through Claude:
