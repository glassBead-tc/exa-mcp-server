## What is MCP? ü§î

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a system that lets AI apps, like Claude Desktop, connect to external tools and data sources. It gives a clear and safe way for AI assistants to work with local services and APIs while keeping the user in control.

## What does this server do? üöÄ

The Exa MCP server:
- Enables AI assistants to perform web searches using Exa's powerful search API
- Provides structured search results including titles, URLs, and content snippets
- Supports real-time web crawling for fresh content
- Integrates with Exa Websets API for creating and managing curated web content collections
- Provides complete webhook and events management for Websets automation workflows
- Handles rate limiting and error cases gracefully


## Prerequisites üìã

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- An [Exa API key](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)
- Git installed

You can verify your Node.js installation by running:
```bash
node --version  # Should show v18.0.0 or higher
```

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### NPM Installation

```bash
npm install -g exa-mcp-server
```

### Using Smithery

To install the Exa MCP server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/exa):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install exa --client claude
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server.git
cd exa-mcp-server
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Create a global link (this makes the server executable from anywhere):

```bash
npm link
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. Configure Claude Desktop to recognize the Exa MCP server

You can find claude_desktop_config.json inside the settings of Claude Desktop app:

Open the Claude Desktop app and enable Developer Mode from the top-left menu bar. 

Once enabled, open Settings (also from the top-left menu bar) and navigate to the Developer Option, where you'll find the Edit Config button. Clicking it will open the claude_desktop_config.json file, allowing you to make the necessary edits. 

OR (if you want to open claude_desktop_config.json from terminal)

#### For macOS:

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration:

```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

#### For Windows:

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration:

```powershell
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 2. Add the Exa server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["/path/to/exa-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Exa API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys).

### 3. Available Tools & Tool Selection

The Exa MCP server includes the following tools:

#### Search Tools
- **web_search**: Performs real-time web searches with optimized results and content extraction.
- **research_paper_search**: Specialized search focused on academic papers and research content.
- **twitter_search**: Dedicated Twitter/X.com search that finds tweets, profiles, and conversations.

#### Websets Tools
- **create_webset**: Create a new Webset for curated web content collections.
- **get_webset**: Retrieve a specific Webset by ID.
- **update_webset**: Update an existing Webset's metadata.
- **list_websets**: List all available Websets with pagination support.
- **cancel_webset**: Cancel a running Webset.
- **delete_webset**: Delete a Webset by ID.

#### Webset Items Tools
- **get_item**: Retrieve a specific item from a Webset.
- **list_items**: List all items in a Webset with filtering options.

#### Webhook Management Tools
- **create_webhook**: Register a new webhook for Websets events.
- **get_webhook**: Retrieve a specific webhook by ID.
- **update_webhook**: Update an existing webhook's configuration.
- **delete_webhook**: Delete a webhook by ID.
- **list_webhooks**: List all registered webhooks.
- **list_webhook_attempts**: View webhook delivery attempts for debugging.

#### Events Tools
- **list_events**: List all events that have occurred in the Websets system.
- **get_event**: Retrieve a specific event by ID.

You can choose which tools to enable by adding the `--tools` parameter to your Claude Desktop configuration:

#### Specify which tools to enable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/exa-mcp-server/build/index.js",
        "--tools=web_search,create_webset,list_webhooks"
      ],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

For the changes to take effect:

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. Look for the üîå icon to verify the Exa server is connected

## Using via NPX

If you prefer to run the server directly, you can use npx:

```bash
# Run with all tools enabled by default
npx exa-mcp-server

# Enable specific tools only
npx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search

# Enable multiple tools
npx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search,research_paper_search

# List all available tools
npx exa-mcp-server --list-tools
```

## Usage üéØ

Once configured, you can ask Claude to perform web searches or manage Exa Websets:

### Web Search Examples

```
Can you search for recent developments in quantum computing?
```

```
Search for and summarize the latest news about artificial intelligence startups in new york.
```

```
Find and analyze recent research papers about climate change solutions.
```

```
Search Twitter for posts from @elonmusk about SpaceX.
```

```
Find tweets from @samaltman that were published in the last week about AI safety.
```

### Websets & Webhooks Examples

```
Create a new Webset to collect information about renewable energy startups in Europe.
```

```
Set up a webhook for my Webset that notifies my system whenever new items are added.
```

```
List all my active webhooks and check their recent delivery attempts.
```

```
Show me all events related to my Webset from the last 24 hours.
```

The server will:

1. Process the request appropriately based on the command
2. Query the Exa API with optimal settings
3. Return formatted results to Claude
4. Handle webhooks and events for automation


## Testing with MCP Inspector üîç

You can test the server directly using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node ./build/index.js
```

This opens an interactive interface where you can explore the server's capabilities, execute search queries, and view cached search results.

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

1. **Server Not Found**
   * Verify the npm link is correctly set up
   * Check Claude Desktop configuration syntax
   * Ensure Node.js is properly installed

2. **API Key Issues**
   * Confirm your EXA_API_KEY is valid
   * Check the EXA_API_KEY is correctly set in the Claude Desktop config
   * Verify no spaces or quotes around the API key

3. **Connection Issues**
   * Restart Claude Desktop completely
   * Check Claude Desktop logs:
   
   ```bash
   # macOS
   tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
   
   # Windows
   type "%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log"
   ```
